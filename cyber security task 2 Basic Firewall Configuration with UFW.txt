# Task 2: Basic Firewall Configuration with UFW

## Objective
To configure a basic firewall using UFW on a Linux system by allowing SSH access and denying HTTP traffic.

## Tool Used
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu/Kali)

## Steps Performed

### 1. Installed UFW
UFW was installed using the system package manager.

### 2. Configured Firewall Rules
- Allowed SSH (Port 22) to ensure secure remote access.
- Denied HTTP (Port 80) to block web traffic.

### 3. Enabled Firewall
The firewall was enabled to enforce the configured rules.

### 4. Verified Firewall Status
The firewall status was checked to confirm that the rules were active and correctly applied.

## Security Significance
- Allowing SSH ensures secure remote administration.
- Denying HTTP prevents unauthorized web service access.
- Firewalls reduce the system’s attack surface.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the use of UFW to implement basic firewall rules and improve system security.
