content = """Nmap Version: 7.95
Platform: Kali Linux (x86_64)

Target Information:
Hostname: kali.lan
IP Address: 192.168.31.85

Scan Commands Used:
1) nmap 192.168.31.85
2) nmap -sV 192.168.31.85
3) nmap -sS -sV -O 192.168.31.85

Scan Results:
Host is up with very low latency.
All 1000 commonly scanned TCP ports are closed.
No open ports or active network services were detected.

OS Detection:
OS detection was inconclusive due to the absence of open ports.

Security Analysis:
- No exposed services reduce the attack surface.
- Closed ports prevent common attacks such as brute-force and service exploitation.
- Indicates a secure default system configuration.

Conclusion:
The Nmap scan confirms that the target system does not expose any active network services.
This scan was performed on a local machine for educational purposes only.
